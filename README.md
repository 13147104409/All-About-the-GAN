# All-About-the-GAN

GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks) are the models that used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework. It was introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014.

The purpose of this repository is providing the summuraized list of the state-of-the-art works on the field of Generative Adversarial Networks since their introduction in 2014.

You can also check out the same data in a tabular format with functionality to filter by year or do a quick search by title [here](https://github.com/hollobit/All-About-the-GAN/blob/master/AllGAN-r2.tsv).

Contributions are welcome. Add links through pull requests or create an issue to lemme know something I missed or to start a discussion.
